# Inheritance

Inheritance provides two advantages:

1. Allows code to be reused, so that only the differences need to be specifies instead of all the similarities repeated.
2. Allows specification of Types

**Important facts**

All objects have a constructor attribute that they have inherited through the prototype chain from Object.prototype.constructor.
